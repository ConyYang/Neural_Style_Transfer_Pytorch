A hand painted graph has such characteristics:
    Black and white gray;
    border lines are heavier;
    the same or similar colors tend to be white;
    slight light source effect
Core principle: Use the gradient value between the pixels and the virtual depth value to reconstruct the image,
and simulate the degree of human vision simulation according to the gray level change.

A graph is a 2D matrix contains elements. Each element is a RGB value.
